Steps in solving a problem:
1. Understanding the problem
2. Coming up with new test cases
3. Coming up with an algorithm (or logic)
4. Convert the algorithm into code
5. Dry run
6. Run the code on the test cases

Problem statement: Given two integers, compute the sum of the integers.
Input format: Two lines, containing one integer each.
Output format: One line, containing one integer.
Sample test cases:
Test case 1:
    Sample input:
        5
        13
    Expected output:
        18
New test cases:
Test case 2:
    Sample input:
        54
        21
    Expected output:
        75
Test case 3:
    Sample input:
        23
        -6
    Expected output:
        17
Test case 4:
    Sample input:
        -5
        -224
    Expected output:
        -229

Algorithm:
1. Read the first number and store it in a variable (say num1)
2. Read the second number and store it in a variable (say num2)
3. Calculate the sum of num1 and num2 and store it in a variable (say sum)
4. Print the sum as output

Data types
- integers
    e.g. 5, 23, 0, -4 etc.
- strings 
    e.g. "Hello", "Sailesh", "bjkda  njw ", "5" etc.
- float
    e.g. 2.3, -5.6, 0.0 etc.
- Boolean
    True
    False
